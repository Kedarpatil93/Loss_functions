# Function Plots
This repository contains a Python script to plot loss functions (MSE, MAE) and activation functions (Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, ReLU) with their derivatives using Matplotlib.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Usage
1. Save `Loss_functions.ipynb` and run with `Loss_functions.ipynb`.
2. View the plot and check the generated `functions_and_derivatives.png`.
